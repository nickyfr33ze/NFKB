## Synopsis

A POS system — sometimes referred to as an ePOS system — enables customers to successfully buy their chosen products from your store at the point of purchase. When we say POS system we’re referring to the hardware and software that allow cashiers to ring up sales.

Square's quote: 
"A POS system allows your business to accept payments from customers and keep track of sales. 
It sounds simple enough, but the setup can work in different ways, depending on whether you sell online, have a physical storefront, or both."

POS : Purchasing Systems
mPOS : Mobile Purchasing System
ePOS : Electronic Payment System

## The OG POS : The Cash Register
Analog and ancient at this point of time. They do not sync with anything whose main purpose is just ring up sales. But you know this already if you spent any time in retail. 

## Key Components
* Display Screen
* Barcode Scanner
* Receipt Printer
* Payment Terminal
* Cash Drawer(s)

Not all have those above, but most should.
The 2 MUST-HAVES is a Display Screen and Payment Terminal

The software is the program that’s running your POS. 
The look, feel, and functionality of your POS software will vary from one provider to another, but most modern systems will have the following features:
* Sale screen
* Inventory management
* Customer relationship management 
* Reporting and analytics

This software can either be on-prem or cloud-based.

## Brain Storm
### Cloud-Based vs On-Prem
* Cost benefit to cloud based services and on-prem?
    * Both would have server costs, but depending on the size of the system and the needs of the business 
    * Might make more sense for a business like a the size of a grocery/department store, a bank (maybe? which is more secure?), 


### Security of both on-prem and cloud based:


### Size (form factor) and maintenance
Larger form facotr and moving parts requires more maintenance (maybe?).
* This can also depend on the type of software and hardware being used on-prem
    * If cloud, this can be tacked on for every cycle
