# Nick Friesen's Knowledge Base üß†
A public repo to house my notes from various courses, labs, and cirriculum I wish to share with the world and document my thought process.

Content will contain, but not be limited to the following:
1. HackTheBox work.
2. TryHackMe boxes.
3. Various cirriculum notes.
4. References to external sources.
5. Code meant for educational purposes.
6. A dev journal to assist in documenting my thought process.
7. A space to house very small projects. Bigger projects will have their own dedicated repos (ex: uCLI (a collection of useful command line tools for Windows, macOS, and Linux)
8. Documentation from external parties.
9. References to third party code, repos, and knowledge bases.
10. A witty attitude to showcase how I think and what I am working on!
